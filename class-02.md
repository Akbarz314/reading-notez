##**How A Browser sees a web page**

1. Receive a page as *Html code*
2. Create a model of the page and store it in memory
3. Use a rendering engine to show the page on screen

#Programmers use code to say "When this event occurs, run that code."
Web browsers use html markup to create a model of the web page. Each element creates its own node.

 ###How do i write a script for a web page?

When creating a web page, you add tags to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allows browsers to show users the appropriate structure of the page.
1. Structural markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragrahps
2. Semantic markup: provides extra info; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quots.

HTML has six levels of headings.

To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <p> tag and closing </p>
HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
They also provide semantic info

## **CSS**
1. What CSS does
2. How CSS works
