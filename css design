### Understanding CSS: Thinking inside the box
- The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that ther's an invisible box around every HTML element.

##**Block and inline elements**
- Block level elements: look like they start on a new line. <h1>- <h6>, <p> and <div> elements.
. *Inline elements flow within the text and don't start on a new line. <b>, <i>.<img>, <em> and <span>

### CSS allows you to create rules that control the way each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.

##** Style Examples**

1. Boxes:Width and Height, Borders, background color, and images position in the browser window.
2. Text: Typeface, size, color, italics, bold, uppercase, lowercase, small-caps 
3. Specific: there are specific ways in which you can style elements such as lists, tables, and forms.

## HOW CSS ASSOCIATES STYLE RULES WITH ELEMENTS
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. It contains two parts, a *selcetor* and a *declaration*

1. Selector- indicate which element the rule applies to.
2. Declarations- indicate how the elements referred in a selector should be styles.

###CSS properties affect how elements are displayed.
- CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: property, and a value.
1. Properties- indicated the aspect of an element you want to change. Color, font, width, height and border.
2. Values: specify settings you want to use for the chosen properties.
