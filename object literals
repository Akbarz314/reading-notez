#**What is an object**??
1. *Objects* group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize in the real world. In an object,variables and functions take on new names.

2. If a variable is part of an object, it's called **property**.
3. If a function is part of an object, it's called a *method*.


##**Document Object Model**
-The DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web pagw while it's in the browser window.
Methods that find elements in the DOM tree are called DOM queries. When you need to wotk with an element more than once, you should use a variable to store the result of this query.

. An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.
.The browser represetns the page using a dom tree.
