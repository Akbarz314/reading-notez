##**HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER**
-Web developers usually talk about three languages that are used to create web pages.
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript

Where possible, aim to keep the threo languages in seperate files, with the HTML page linking to CSS and Javascript files.
- Each language forms a *seperate* layer with a different purpose. Each layer from left to right builds on the previous one.
 
#**Progressive Enhancement**

- These 3 layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called progressive ehancement.

1. HTML ONLY: Starting with the HTML layer allows you to focus on the most important thing about your site. It's *content*.
2. HTML & CSS: Adding the CSS rules in a seperate file keeps rules regarding to how the page looks away from the content itself.
3. HTML, CSS, and Javascript: The Javascript is added last and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of the interacting with the site.

####**WHAT IS A VARIABLE**
1. A SCRIPT will have to temporarily store the bits  info it needs to do a job. It stores this data in a *variable*.
- A variable is a good name for this concept b/c the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs.

### How do we delare Variables?

- Before you can use a variAble, you need to announce that you want to use it. This involves creating the variable and giving it a name. Programmers say that you **declare** the  variable.
1. Once you have created a variable, you can tell it what info you would like it to store for you. Programmers say that you assign a value to the variable.
